# The Smart Students Credo

> What Smart Students Know by Adam Robinson 

- **Principle #1:** Nobody can teach you as well as you can teach yourself.
- **Principle #2:** Merely listening to the teachers and completing their assessments is *never* enough.
- **Principle #3:** Not everything you are assigned to read or asked to do is equally important.
- **Principle #4:** Grades are just subjective opinions.
- **Principle #5:** Making mistakes (and occasionally appearing foolish) is the price you pay for learning and improving.
- **Principle #6:** The point of a question is to get you to think - *not* simply to answer it.
- **Principle #7:** You're in school to learn to think for yourself, not to repeat what your textbooks and teachers tell you.
- **Principle #8:** Subjects do not always seem interesting and relevant, but being actively engaged in learning them is better than being passively bored and not learning them.
- **Principle #9:** Few things are as potentially difficult, frustrating, or frightening as genuine learning, yet *nothing* is so rewarding and empowering.
- **Principle #10:** How well you do in school reflects your attitude and your method, not your ability.
- **Principle #11:** If you're doing it for the grades or for the approval of others, you're missing the satisfactions of the process and putting your self-esteem at the mercy of things outside your control. 
- **Principle #12:** School is a game, but it's a very important game.
