**Question #1:** What's my purpose for learning this?
-----------------------------------------------------
Before you start learning you need to know why your learning so you know what you should be looking for.

**Question #2:** What do I already know about this topic?
---------------------------------------------------------
After glancing at the title but still before you start reading, you should warm up by taking a couple of minutes to jot down quickly evertyhing you know about the topic.

- What do you know about the topic
- What the topic reminds you of
- What you'd like to know or expect to learn

**Question #3:** What's the big picture here?
---------------------------------------------
Before you start reading the material closely, you skim through it to get an outline of the main points.

Look For:

- Main Ideas and Themes
- Important Concepts and Terms
- Overall Organization

**Question #4:** What's the author going to say next?
-----------------------------------------------------
As you begin to read the material closely, you try to stay one step ahead of the of the author by anticipating what he or she will say next.

**Question #5:** What are the "expert questions"?
-------------------------------------------------
Each subject asks a unique set of questions that you need to keep in mind as your read.
 
**Question #6:** What questions does the information raise for me?
------------------------------------------------------------------
As you read, you need to be aware of the other questions the material should be raising in your mind.

**Question #7:** What information is important here?
----------------------------------------------------
As you're reading, you need to decide what information is important enough to include in your notes. Whats important will depent on your purpose (Question #1).

**Question #8:** How can I paraphrase or summarise this information?
--------------------------------------------------------------------
As you take notes on the important information you are selecting, you should translate the authors words into your own, using as few as you can.

**Question #9:** How can I organise this information?
-----------------------------------------------------
Once youve finished taking notes, explore them to see how the information is organized and whether you can create any new groupings or links that make sense.

**Question #10:** How can I picture this information?
-----------------------------------------------------
Again looking over your notes, your goal now is to translate as much of the information into symbols and pictures as possible.

**Question #11:** What's my hook for remembering this information? 
------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that you've worked with the information and begun to understand it, you need a hook or gimmick to ensure that you'll be able to remember what you need to know for tests.

**Question #12:** How does this information fit in with what I already know?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you look over your notes, you should be trying to see how the new information fits in with what you already know - not just about the topic but others as well.
